Vehicle and Animal Classification using Pre-Trained CIFAR Model

Overview

This project utilizes a pre-trained CIFAR model to classify vehicles and animals.

Model Architecture:

The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with dropout regularization.

Performance

The model has achieved a test accuracy of 73%. However, the confusion matrix reveals that misclassification often occurs between cat and dog classes.

Future Work

To improve the model's performance, the following steps can be taken:

Collect more data to increase the size of the training set

Experiment with different architectures, such as transfer learning

Fine-tune the hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance
